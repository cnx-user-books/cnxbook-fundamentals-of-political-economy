  <md:title>The Ethics and Economics of Choosing Publicly</md:title>
  <md:abstract>There are two ways to get ahead in business. One way is to use the market process, bringing consumers something they want at a price they're happy to pay. The other way to get ahead in business is the political process, by lobbying bureaucrats and lawmakers to grant special favors to your business, or industry. In this video, Professor Dan Russell of the University of Arizona explains public choice economics, a discipline tries to understand what it is about the political process that makes it possible for it to be exploited.</md:abstract>
