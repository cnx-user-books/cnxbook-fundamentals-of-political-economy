  <md:abstract>If Marshall is entitled to anything, surely he's entitled not to have Taney break his legs. And yet, Taney can obtain a license to drive a car even though that increases the risk that he might break Marshall's legs. So, why shouldn’t Marshall simply be able to forbid Taney to drive? In this video, Professor Dan Russell of the University of Arizona explains how property rules and liability rules are used to protect different types of entitlements.</md:abstract>
